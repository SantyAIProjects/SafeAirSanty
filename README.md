## 🌟 Mission

To design a proactive safety system that uses artificial intelligence to detect malfunctions and autonomously deploy life-saving capsules—empowering passengers and crews with a new standard of survival.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **AI Malfunction Detection**  
  Real-time monitoring of critical flight systems to detect errors—whether mechanical or human.

- **Autonomous Safety Capsules**  
  Up to 8 modular units equipped with:
  - GPS + Navigation
  - Medical Kits
  - Drone-like self-guidance
  - Parachute-assisted descent on landing

- **Scalable Design**  
  Capsule count and size adapt to aircraft models (e.g., Boeing 737 = 8 capsules).

- **Fail-Safe Activation**  
  AI handles timing, trajectory, and capsule deployment when failure is imminent.
